# Support Vector Machines

- The SVM algorithm is applied with the penalty cost using the Radial Basis Function (RBF Kernel).
- The best values of SVM algorithm parameters are obtained using cross-validation method and grid search for the given dataset using Python.
- A coarse search and a fine search are performed on the dataset to estimate the search that maximizes the accuracy for the given dataset.
